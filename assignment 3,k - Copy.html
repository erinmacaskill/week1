<hr>

<p>I am currently writing a paragraph for testing, I want there to be a lot of words for this example so I'm writing random things. I tested this and it wasn't enough text, so here we go again. Writing random things. In the future this will be important information.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">New section</h3>

<p>This is where more important information would go. Maybe I need a topic to write about, that's extra work though. But anyway, I'm just writing, my website doesn't look amazing right now, but soon I'm sure it will be great. </p>
