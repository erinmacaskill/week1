<hr>

<h2 style="text-align:center; color:navy;">Introduction</h2>

<p>As you can see, this second page is much different than the first. So far this website was just practice, no information had been put yet.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center; color:navy;">Emphasized</h2>

<p><em>I am currently writing a paragraph for testing, I want there to be a lot of words for this example so I'm writing random things. I tested this and it wasn't enough text, so here we go again. Writing random things. In the future this will be important information.</em></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center; color:navy">Bold</h2>

<p><b>This is where more important information would go. Maybe I need a topic to write about, that's extra work though. But anyway, I'm just writing, my website doesn't look amazing right now, but soon I'm sure it will be great.</b></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center; color:navy">Small/Delete</h2>

<p><small>I'm using this to text the small command, I don't know what it'll look like, but I'm excited to see.</small><del>Now I've switched to the deelete text, I hope this works.(update:it worked)</del></p>
