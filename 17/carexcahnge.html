<p>At Cars R Us, we want everyone to have a good, working car. So if your car doesn't work anymore, or it does work but you don't need what it offers anymore. You can come in with that car,
and we will give you a consultant session and give a value for your car. This can be used as credit when buying a new car, so you can buy a new one at less of the listed price, or get money
back!</p>

<h6>
    Cars R Us has all the right to turn your car away if it's not usable, or you're not willing to pay the fees to get the car fixed. Some condition may apply, such as model and condition. Call us at 
    (123)456-7890 for more information.
